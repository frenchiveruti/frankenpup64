# frankenpup64

first public release in years of my own puppylinux based distro

Features;

- 64bits with mutilib.
- slackware-14.2 comptible (kinda with alienbob's repos, oficial repos could be dangerous)
- Kernel 5
- .pet compatibility (dangerous if the packages come from another puplet)
  I allowed .pet compatibility for the sake of friends helping me compiling and packaging software until I code a proper package  creation system (right now it's just a script to create the .fxz)
- cli package manager for .fxz (primitive but functional with some kind of dep resolving based on a package database)
