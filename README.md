# frankenpup64

first public release in years of my own puppylinux based distro

Features;

- 64bits with mutilib.
- slackware-14.2 comptible (kinda with alienbob's repos, oficial repos may be dangerous)
- Kernel 5
- .pet compatibility (dangerous)
- cli package manager for .pxz (primitive but functional)
